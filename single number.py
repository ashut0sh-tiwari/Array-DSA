"""In Python, XOR is a bitwise operator that is also known as Exclusive OR. It is a logical operator which outputs 1 when either of the operands is 1 (one is 1 and the other one is 0), but both are not 1, and both are not 0. The symbol for XOR in Python is '^' and in mathematics, its symbol is 'âŠ•'."""
